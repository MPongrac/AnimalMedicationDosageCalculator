# AnimalMedicationDosageCalculator
A simplified calculator for people with animals in stalls who need to medicate their animals.

This project is a result of my wife raising chickens.  They periodically need to be medicated through their drinking water and she wanted a simple way to calculate the amount of medication as well as how to divide it amongst the different stalls in the coop.  

Initially, I created something in Excel for her to use.  Then, I realized that other people could probably use something like this as well.  So, I decided to put my skills to use and created this project to put it online for everyone to be able to use.

It was designed to be generic so that more people could use it.  There are no restrictions on animal type or size.  The units are imperial as well as metric.

Please enjoy the calculator and tell your friends about it if you find it useful.

If anyone wishes to add other languages, feel free to contact me via github.
