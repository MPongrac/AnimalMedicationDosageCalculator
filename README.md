# AnimalMedicationDosageCalculator
A simplified calculator for people with animals in stalls who need to medicate their animals.

This project is a result of my wife raising chickens.  They periodically need to be medicated through their drinking water and she wanted a simple way to calculate the amount of medication as well as how to divide it amongst the different stalls in the coop.  

Initially, I created something in Excel for her to use.  Then, I realized that other people could probably use something like this as well.  So, I decided to put my skills to use and created this project to put it online for everyone to be able to use.
